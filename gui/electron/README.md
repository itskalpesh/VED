# VED GUI — Electron

Electron shell for VED. Responsibilities:
- Chat interface, command bar, system status, tool execution feedback, voice controls.
- No OS logic; no decision making. Communicates only with Python brain (e.g. via stdio or HTTP).

Placeholder: implement when Phase 5 is fully scoped.
